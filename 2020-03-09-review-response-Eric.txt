== COMMENTS ==

-- Section 1 --
Does the following assertion always stand ? "This contrasts with the wired
network setting where traffic flows from all users share the same queue."

[authors] Not always but it's a typical setting for wired networks. We revised the
sentence accordingly: 

"This contrasts with a typical wired network setting ... at the bottleneck."

-- Section 3.1.2 --
As a frequent high speed train passenger, I would have appreciated a simulation
with mobility of 300 km/h ;-)

[authors] Thanks for your interest in testing out a high-speed mobility case :)
For now, the current recommended parameters are limited to simulations that we
have already evaluated. We are open to adding new test parameters in future drafts
_after_ someone has test driven that case in simulations.

-- Section 3.1.2 --
s/10Mhz/10MHz/ ?


[authors] Fixed. Thanks.
