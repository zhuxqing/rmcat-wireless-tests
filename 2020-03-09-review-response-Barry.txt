COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You include the BCP 14 boilerplate and references, but the only BCP 14 key word
in the document is a MUST in Section 6 that seems like it doesnt need to be BCP
14 in this document (it seems to refer to a tenet, not a requirement specified
in this document).  I suggest removing the boilerplate and the references and
making the “must” lower case.


[authors] Thanks for noting this. The boilerplate is removed and all mentions
of must/should/may/... are now in lower case.
