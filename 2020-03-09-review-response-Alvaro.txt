COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If my reading of the mailing list is correct, it looks like this document was
the result of merging draft-sarker-rmcat-cellular-eval-test-cases and
draft-fu-rmcat-wifi-test-case.  It would be nice if this document was tagged as
replacing them.
