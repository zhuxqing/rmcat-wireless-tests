 [Authors] Great suggestion.  Sec. 4 is now revised as follows. Note that we've also
updated the statistics for 11ac and 11n to catch up on their evolution over time.

	Unless otherwise mentioned, test cases in this section are described using the
	underlying PHY- and MAC-layer parameters based on the IEEE 802.11n Standard.
	Statistics collected from enterprise Wi-Fi networks show that the two dominant
	physical modes are 802.11n and 802.11ac, accounting for 41% and 58% of
	connected devices. As Wi-Fi standards evolve over time, for instance, with the
	introduction of the emerging Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) products, the PHY- and MAC-
	layer test case specifications need to be updated accordingly to reflect such
	changes.
	...

	All test cases described below can be carried out using simulations, e.g. based
	on [ns-2] or [ns-3]. When feasible, it is also encouraged to perform testbed-
	based evaluations using Wi-Fi access points and endpoints running up-to-date
	IEEE 802.11 protocols, such as 802.11ac and the emerging Wi-Fi 6, to verify the
	viability of the candidate schemes.

[Authors]  Thanks for raising this point.  The text in that section is now revised as:

	The fixed user is connected to the Internet via wired connection with sufficiently
	high bandwidth, for instance, 10 Gbps, so that the system is resource-limited on the
	wireless interface.

[Authors]  We've discussed with the reviewer offline regarding this topic.  To more accurately describe
the nature of packet losses over Wi-Fi, the wording in the 3rd bullet point of Sec
4 has been revised to:

	Packet transmissions over Wi-Fi are susceptible to contentions and collisions
	over the air. Consequently, traffic load beyond a certain utilization level over a
	Wi-Fi network can introduce frequent collisions over the air and significant
	network overhead, as well as packet drops due to buffer overflow at the
	transmitters. This, in turn, leads to excessive delay, retransmissions, packet
	losses and lower effective bandwidth for applications. Note, however, that the
	consequent delay and loss patterns caused by collisions are qualitatively
	different from those induced by congestion over a wired connection.

[Authors] Even though it is possible to carry out tests over LTE (and 5G) networks, and actually
it is already done so today, these tests cannot in the general case be carried out in a deterministic fashion
or to ensure repeatability, as these network are in the control of cellular operators and there can various
amounts of competing traffic in the same cell(s). In practice, it is only in underground mines that one can
carry out near deterministic testing. Even there, it is not guaranteed either as workers in the mines carry
with them their IPhones and Androids.  Also, the underground mining setting may not reflect typical
usage patterns of a urban setting. 

The main reason for the lack of suggestion for testbed-based evaluations for cellular in the draft is out
of the above concerns of practical feasibility,  whereas Wi-Fi equipment is relatively lower cost to acquire
and setup.  Based on the reviewer comments, we've revised the discussion in this paragraph (Sec. 4) to
tune down the level of recommendation for testbed-based Wi-Fi evaluations to "encourage": 

	All test cases described below can be carried out using simulations, e.g. based
	on [ns-2] or [ns-3]. When feasible, it is also encouraged to perform testbed-
	based evaluations using Wi-Fi access points and endpoints running up-to-date
	IEEE 802.11 protocols, such as 802.11ac and the emerging Wi-Fi 6, to verify the
	viability of the candidate schemes.

[Authors] This was indeed a "to-be-decided" reminder to the editors.  We've updated
the reference for the default congestion control scheme of TCP to [RFC5681] so
as to align with the eval-test draft (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rmcat-
eval-test-10, see Sec. 5.6 and 5.7).  

The draft now specifies background FTP traffic over TCP (using default congestion
control per RFC5681) in both Sections 3.1 and 3.2 for cellular test cases.

[Authors]  Thanks for catching all these nits via your "minor/editorial" comments. The
draft has been updated accordingly.
