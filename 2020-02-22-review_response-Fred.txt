Reviewer: Fred Baker
Review Result: I have a few comments

I have reviewed this document as part of the Operational directorate's ongoing
effort to review all IETF documents being processed by the IESG. These comments
were written with the intent of improving the operational aspects of the IETF
drafts. Comments that are not addressed in last call may be included in AD
reviews during the IESG review. Document editors and WG chairs should treat
these comments just like any other last call comments.

My first comment will probably be addressed by the RFC Editor, but I'll bring
it up. In several places, the language of the document is awkward at best. One
that sticks in my mind is the description of a network containing an 802.11b
domain as containing an "abnomaly". I'm pretty sure it's a typo that a standard
spell checker would have complained about, but Google thinks it's also a skin
care product. The document would benefit from a spell check and an editing pass
by a native English speaker.

[authors] Apologies for the typos and thanks for catching it. The updated draft has
gone through one pass of editorial changes in an effort to improve its language usage.
Additional revision suggestions from the RFC Editor shall be very much appreciated. 

The second relates to a specific recommendation in the document concerning
802.11b networks. The issue is that the dynamic range of 802.11 network speeds
is very wide - 802.11b is theoretically capable of 11 MBPS, but typically
achieves something on the order of 2-5 MBPS, while 802.11ac is theoretically
capable of 1.3 GBPS. The difference in speed an introduce issues in network
behavior. Where 802.11b is relevant, the document suggests that "additional
test cases can be added" to cover the case. I suspect that the real issue isn't
802.11b, although the paper cited refers to it; the issue is a network
containing a mix of speeds with a broad range, with the slower ones perturbing
the behavior of the faster ones. I'd suggest that the authors think about the
fundamental issue, and make specific recommendations appropriate to the case
(such as defining effective ranges for link speeds).

[authors] You are right that the fundamental issue is not 802.11b per se, but rather the effect of]
mixing heterogeneous link speeds over a wide range. So we’ve revised the sentence in 
Sec.4 as:

“Presence of legacy devices (e.g., ones operating only in IEEE 802.11b at a much lower PHY-layer link rate) can significantly slow down the rest of a modern Wi-Fi network. As discussed in [Heusse2003], the main reason for such anomaly is that legacy devices take much longer to transmit the same packet over a slower link than over a faster link, thereby consuming substantial portion of the transmission opportunities over the air.”  


The text of Sec. 4.3.2 (Effects of presence of legacy devices) has also been revised to emphasis on the presence of devices with operating at heterogeneously link rates in these additional test cases, instead of tying them with 802.11b.  

(for the record, I sent this to ops-dir@, but don't seem to be able to link to the post.)


========

Hi. Gunter has asked me to review this, and I'm reading it. I have a question, if you don't mind.

In a couple of places, the document highlights the issues that occur in a network containing an 802.11b link. I find myself wondering whether this issue scales with bitrate - as technologies increase in speed, will other elderly technologies fall into the category? Is the point that the link is 802.11b, or is it that the link is relatively slow compared to other links in the network (which is something we have observed in wireline networks as well)? If the latter, would it be better to discuss "relatively slow links, such as 802.11b" as opposed to "beware the evil 802.11b technology"?

[authors]  You are right that the underlying issue is not specific to 802.11b, but rather the presence of heterogeneously link speeds spanning a wide range.  We have therefore revised the sentence in the intro discussion of Sec. 4 as: 

“Presence of legacy devices (e.g., ones operating only in IEEE 802.11b at a much lower PHY-layer link rate) can significantly slow down the rest of a modern Wi-Fi network.”
