COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to Adam for noting the author-count already.

Section 3

   Different mobile operators deploy their own cellular networks with
   their own set of network functionalities and policies.  Usually, a
   mobile operator network includes 2G, EDGE, 3G and 4G radio access

Is 2G still "typical"?  I was given to understand it was getting phased
out.

[authors]  Agree that 2G is now outdated. We've revised the sentence to:

"Usually, a mobile operator network includes a range of radio access technologies such as 3G and 4G/LTE." 

Section 3.1, 3.2

How do I tell how much time is "enough time to warm-up the network"?

[authors] Thanks for noting this. We've added a sentence to clarify that the evaluation
period should start 30 seconds after initialization. 

Section 4.2.3

   b.  Multiple RTP-based media flows sharing the wireless uplink:N = 16
       (all downlink); M = 0.  When multiple clients attempt to transmit

I'm not sure how to interpret the parenthetical; is it a copy/paste
issue from (a) that should read "all uplink"?

[authors] Thanks for catching this typo. It's meant to be "all uplink". Fixed now.
