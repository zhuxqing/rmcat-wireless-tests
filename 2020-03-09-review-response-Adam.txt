COMMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the work that went into creating this document.

ID Nits correctly reports:

  == Unused Reference: 'I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements' is defined on line
     998, but no explicit reference was found in the text

[authors] Thanks for the catch. This extraneous reference is now removed. 

As a note for the AD: I can’t find a justification in the ballot or shepherd’s
writeup for why this document has six authors instead of a smaller number of
editors and a list of contributors. It would be nice to capture the exception
rationale in one of those two places for posterity.

[authors] Thanks for noting this. We've updated the author list and have stated
contributions of previous co-authors in a new Contributor section.
