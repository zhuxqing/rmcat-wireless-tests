    <abstract>
      <t>It is evident that to ensure seamless and robust user experience
      across all type of access networks multimedia communication suits should
      adapt to the changing network conditions. There is an ongoing effort in
      IETF RMCAT working group to standardize rate adaptive algorithm(s) to be
      used in the real-time interactive communication. In this document test
      cases are described to evaluate the performances of the proposed
      endpoint adaptation solutions in LTE networks and Wi-Fi networks. The
      proposed algorithms should be evaluated using the test cases defined in
      this document to select most optimal solutions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Wireless networks (both cellular and Wi-Fi <xref
      target="IEEE802.11"></xref> local area network) are an integral part of
      the Internet. Mobile devices connected to the wireless networks produces
      huge amount of media traffic in the Internet. They covers the scenarios
      of having a video call in the bus to media consumption sitting on a
      couch in a living room. It is a well known fact that the characteristic
      and challenges for offering service over wireless network are very
      different than providing the same over a wired network. Even though
      RMCAT basic test cases defines number of test cases that covers lots of
      effects of the impairments visible in the wireless networks but there
      are characteristics and dynamics those are unique to particular wireless
      environment. For example, in the LTE the base station maintains queues
      per radio bearer per user hence it gives different interaction when all
      traffic from user share the same queue. Again, the user mobility in a
      cellular network is different than the user mobility in a Wi-Fi network.
      Thus, It is important to evaluate the performance of the proposed RMCAT
      candidates separately in the cellular mobile networks and Wi-Fi local
      networks (IEEE 802.11xx protocol family ).</t>

      <t>RMCAT evaluation criteria <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria"></xref> document provides the
      guideline to perform the evaluation on candidate algorithms and
      recognizes wireless networks to be important access link. However, it
      does not provides particular test cases to evaluate the performance of
      the candidate algorithm. In this document we describe test cases
      specifically targeting cellular networks such as LTE networks and Wi-Fi
      local networks.</t>

    <section title="Cellular Network Specific Test Cases">
      <t>A cellular environment is more complicated than a wireline ditto
      since it seeks to provide services in the context of variable available
      bandwidth, location dependencies and user mobilities at different
      speeds. In a cellular network the user may reach the cell edge which may
      lead to a significant amount of retransmissions to deliver the data from
      the base station to the destination and vice versa. These network links
      or radio links will often act as a bottleneck for the rest of the
      network which will eventually lead to excessive delays or packet drops.
      An efficient retransmission or link adaptation mechanism can reduce the
      packet loss probability but there will still be some packet losses and
      delay variations. Moreover, with increased cell load or handover to a
      congested cell, congestion in transport network will become even worse.
      Besides, there are certain characteristics which make the cellular
      network different and challenging than other types of access network
      such as Wi-Fi and wired network. In a cellular network -</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The bottleneck is often a shared link with relatively few
          users.<list style="symbols">
              <t>The cost per bit over the shared link varies over time and is
              different for different users.</t>

              <t>Left over/ unused resource can be grabbed by other greedy
              users.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Queues are always per radio bearer hence each user can have many
          of such queues.</t>

          <t>Users can experience both Inter and Intra Radio Access Technology
          (RAT) handovers ("handover" definition in <xref
          target="HO-def-3GPP"></xref> ).</t>

          <t>Handover between cells, or change of serving cells (see in <xref
          target="HO-LTE-3GPP"></xref> and <xref target="HO-UMTS-3GPP"></xref>
          ) might cause user plane interruptions which can lead to bursts of
          packet losses, delay and/or jitter. The exact behavior depends on
          the type of radio bearer. Typically, the default best effort bearers
          do not generate packet loss, instead packets are queued up and
          transmitted once the handover is completed.</t>

          <t>The network part decides how much the user can transmit.</t>

          <t>The cellular network has variable link capacity per user<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Can vary as fast as a period of milliseconds.</t>

              <t>Depends on lots of facts (such as distance, speed,
              interference, different flows).</t>

              <t>Uses complex and smart link adaptation which makes the link
              behavior ever more dynamic.</t>

              <t>The scheduling priority depends on the estimated
              throughput.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Both Quality of Service (QoS) and non-QoS radio bearers can be
          used.</t>
        </list>Hence, a real-time communication application operating in such
      a cellular network need to cope with shared bottleneck link and variable
      link capacity, event likes handover, non-congestion related loss, abrupt
      change in bandwidth (both short term and long term) due to handover,
      network load and bad radio coverage. Even though 3GPP define QoS bearers
      <xref target="QoS-3GPP"></xref> to ensure high quality user experience,
      adaptive real-time applications are desired.</t>

      <t>Different mobile operators deploy their own cellular network with
      their own set of network functionalities and policies. Usually, a mobile
      operator network includes 2G, EDGE, 3G and 4G radio access technologies.
      Looking at the specifications of such radio technologies it is evident
      that only 3G and 4G radio technologies can support the high bandwidth
      requirements from real-time interactive video applications. The future
      real-time interactive application will impose even greater demand on
      cellular network performance which makes 4G (and beyond radio
      technologies) more suitable access technology for such genre of
      application.</t>

      <t>The key factors to define test cases for cellular network are</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Shared and varying link capacity</t>

          <t>Mobility</t>

          <t>Handover</t>
        </list>However, for cellular network it is very hard to separate such
      events from one another as these events are heavily related. Hence
      instead of devising separate test cases for all those important events
      we have divided the test case in two categories. It should be noted that
      in the following test cases the goal is to evaluate the performance of
      candidate algorithms over radio interface of the cellular network. Hence
      it is assumed that the radio interface is the bottleneck link between
      the communicating peers and that the core network does not add any extra
      congestion in the path. Also the combination of multiple access
      technologies such as one user has LTE connection and another has Wi-Fi
      connection is kept out of the scope of this document. However, later
      those additional scenarios can also be added in this list of test cases.
      While defining the test cases we assumed a typical real-time telephony
      scenario over cellular networks where one real-time session consists of
      one voice stream and one video stream. We recommend that an LTE network
      simulator is used for the test cases defined in this document, for
      example-NS-3 LTE simulator <xref target="LTE-simulator"></xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="VNL" title="Varying Network Load">
        <t>The goal of this test is to evaluate the performance of the
        candidate congestion control algorithm under varying network load. The
        network load variation is created by adding and removing network users
        a.k.a. User Equipments (UEs) during the simulation. In this test case,
        each of the user/UE in the media session is an RMCAT compliant
        endpoint. The arrival of users follows a Poisson distribution, which
        is proportional to the length of the call, so that the number of users
        per cell is kept fairly constant during the evaluation period. At the
        beginning of the simulation there should be enough amount of time to
        warm-up the network. This is to avoid running the evaluation in an
        empty network where network nodes are having empty buffers, low
        interference at the beginning of the simulation. This network
        initialization period is therefore excluded from the evaluation
        period.</t>

        <t>This test case also includes user mobility and competing traffic.
        The competing traffics includes both same kind of flows (with same
        adaptation algorithms) and different kind of flows (with different
        service and congestion control). The investigated congestion control
        algorithms should show maximum possible network utilization and
        stability in terms of rate variations, lowest possible end to end
        frame latency, network latency and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) at different
        cell load level.</t>

        <section anchor="NC-VNL" title="Network Connection">
          <t>Each mobile user is connected to a fixed user. The connection
          between the mobile user and fixed user consists of a LTE radio
          access, an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and an Internet connection. The
          mobile user is connected to the EPC using LTE radio access
          technology which is further connected to the Internet. The fixed
          user is connected to the Internet via wired connection with no
          bottleneck (practically infinite bandwidth). The Internet and wired
          connection in this setup does not add any network impairments to the
          test, it only adds 10ms of one-way transport propagation delay.</t>

          <t>The path from the fixed user to mobile user is defines as
          "Downlink" and the path from mobile user to the fixed user is
          defined as "Uplink". We assume that only uplink or downlink is
          congested for the mobile users. Hence, we recommend that the uplink
          and downlink simulations are run separately. <figure align="center"

      <section title="Bad Radio Coverage">
        <t>The goal of this test is to evaluate the performance of candidate
        congestion control algorithm when users visit part of the network with
        bad radio coverage. The scenario is created by using larger cell
        radius than previous test case. In this test case each of the user/UE
        in the media session is an RMCAT compliant endpoint. The arrival of
        users follows a Poisson distribution, which is proportional to the
        length of the call, so that the number of users per cell is kept
        fairly constant during the evaluation period. At the beginning of the
        simulation there should be enough amount of time to warm-up the
        network. This is to avoid running the evaluation in an empty network
        where network nodes are having empty buffers, low interference at the
        beginning of the simulation. This network initialization period is
        therefore excluded from the evaluation period.</t>

        <t>This test case also includes user mobility and competing traffic.
        The competing traffics includes same kind of flows (with same
        adaptation algorithms) . The investigated congestion control
        algorithms should show maximum possible network utilization and
        stability in terms of rate variations, lowest possible end to end
        frame latency, network latency and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) at different
        cell load level.</t>

    <section title="Wi-Fi Networks Specific Test Cases">
      <t>Given the prevalence of Internet access links over Wi-Fi, it is
      important to evaluate candidate RMCAT congestion control solutions over
      Wi-Fi test cases. Such evaluations should also highlight the inherent
      different characteristics of Wi-Fi networks in contrast to Wired
      networks:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The wireless radio channel is subject to interference from nearby
          transmitters, multipath fading, and shadowing, causing fluctuations
          in link throughput and sometimes an error-prone communication
          environment</t>

          <t>Available network bandwidth is not only shared over the air
          between cocurrent users, but also between uplink and downlink
          traffic due to the half duplex nature of wireless transmission
          medium.</t>

          <t>Packet transmessions over Wi-Fi are susceptible to contentions
          and collisions over the air. Consequently, traffic load beyond a
          certain utilization level over a Wi-Fi network can introduce
          frequent collisions and significant network overhead. This, in turn,
          leads to excessive delay, retransmission, loss and lower effective
          bandwidth for applications.</t>

          <t>The IEEE 802.11 standard (i.e., Wi-Fi) supports multi-rate
          transmission capabilities by dynamically choosing the most
          appropriate modulation scheme for a given received singal strength.
          A different choice of Physical-layer rate will lead to different
          application-layer throughput.</t>

          <t>Presence of legancy 802.11b networks can significantly slow down
          the the rest of a modern Wi-Fi Network, since it takes longer to
          transmit the same packet over a slower link than over a faster link.
          [Editor's note: maybe include a reference here instead.]</t>

          <t>Handover from one Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) to another may cause
          packet delay and loss.</t>

          <t>IEEE 802.11e defined EDCA/WMM (Enhanced DCF Channel Access/Wi-Fi
          Multi-Media) to give voice and video streams higher priority over
          pure data applications (e.g., file transfers).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>As we can see here, presence of Wi-Fi network in different network
      topologies and traffic arrival can exert different impact on the network
      performance in terms of video transport rate, packet loss and delay
      that, in turn, effect end-to-end real-time multimedia congestion
      control.</t>

      <t>Throughout this draft, unless otherwise mentioned, test cases are
      described using 802.11g due to its wide availability in network
      simulation platform. In practice, however, statistics collected from
      enterprise networks show that the dominant physical modes are 802.11n
      and 802.11ac, accounting for 73.6% and 22.5% of enterprise network
      users, respectively. Whenever possible, it is recommended to extend some
      of the experiments to 802.11n and 802.11ac, so as to reflect a more
      modern Wi-Fi network setting.</t>

      <t>Since Wi-Fi network normally connects to a wired infrastructure,
      either the wired network or the Wi-Fi network could be the bottleneck.
      In the following section, we describe basic test cases for both
      scenarios separately.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-wired-bottleneck"
               title="Bottleneck in Wired Network">
        <t>The test scenarios below are intended to mimic the set up of video
        conferencing over Wi-Fi connections from the home. Typically, the
        Wi-Fi home network is not congested and the bottleneck is present over
        the wired home access link. Although it is expected that test
        evaluation results from this section are similar to those from test
        cases defined for wired networks (see <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-test"></xref>), it is worthwhile to run
        through these tests as sanity checks.</t>

          <t><xref target="fig-wifi-test-topology"></xref> shows topology of
          the network for Wi-Fi test cases. The test contains multiple mobile
          nodes (MNs) connected to a common Wi-Fi access point (AP) and their
          corresponding wired clients on fixed nodes (FNs). Each connection
          carries either RMCAT or TCP traffic flow. Directions of the flows

        <section title="Typical test scenarios">
          <t>This sections describes a few specific test scenarios that are
          deemed as important for understanding behavior of a RMCAT candidate
          solution over a Wi-Fi network. <list style="symbols">
              <t>Multiple RMCAT Flows Sharing the Wireless Downlink: This test
              case is for studying the impact of contention on competing RMCAT
              flows. Specifications for IEEE 802.11g with a physical-layer
              transmission rate of 54 Mbps is chosen. Note that retransmission
              and MAC-layer headers and control packets may be sent at a lower
              link speed. The total application-layer throughput (reasonable
              distance, low interference and small number of contention
              stations) for 802.11g is around 20 Mbps. Consequently, a total
              of N=16 RMCAT flows are needed for saturating the wireless
              interface in this experiment. Evaluation of a given candidate
              solution should focus on whether downlink RMCAT flows can
              stablize at a fair share of bandwidth.</t>

              the wireless interface, they introduce more frequent contentions
              and potentially collisions. When running the test with N=16
              uplink RMCAT flows, per-flow throughput is expected to be lower
              than that in the previous downlink-only scenario. Evaluation of
              a given candidate solution should focus on whether uplink flows
              can stablize at a fair share of bandwidth.</t>

              <t>Multiple RMCAT flows in the presence of background TCP

              candidate solution.</t>

          <t>Wi-Fi roaming need scanning, authentication and re-association
          which will cause packet drops and delay, and interrupt the network
          connection. RMCAT congestion control algorithms should at least
          recover (if affected by the transition process) after roaming.</t>

          <t>The phone can switch automatically between Wi-Fi and Cellular
          network when the other is not available, and some phones like
          "Samsung Galaxy" have smart network switch to switching to network
          has better connectivity automatically. Unlike Wi-Fi Roaming, such
          kind of switch might or might not interrupt the network connection,
          and might change the route. RMCAT congestion control should be able
          to cope with the changes.</t>

        <section anchor="sec-edca-wmm-usage" title="EDCA/WMM usage">
          <t>EDCA/WMM is prioritized QoS with four traffic classes (or Access
          Categories) with differing priorities. RMCAT flow should have better
          performance (lower delay, less loss) with EDCA/WMM enabled when
          competing against non-interactive background traffic (e.g., file
          transfers). When most of the traffic over Wi-Fi is dominated by
          media, however, turning on WMM may actually degrade performance.
          This is a topic worthy of further investigation.</t>
